        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Keith Petro. I was born in the city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan
        , where I attended the University of Saskatchewan. I obtained a Bachelor's
        of Science in Computer Engineering in 2016 and went on to complete more
        courses in Computer Science to obtain another degree.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h1>Education</h1>
    
    <h2>B.Sc.E. Computer Engineering</h2>
    <p>After highschool I enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan in Engineering
    in 2012. While completing this degree I obtained a strong interest in engineering,
    development, communications systems and digital design.</p>
    
    <h2>B.Sc. Computer Science</h2>
    <p>After graduating with my degree in Computer Engineering I returned to the university
    to persue a further degree in Computer Science and expand my knowledge and
    experience in software development.</p>
    
    <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
    
    <h1>Projects</h1>
    
    <h2>Yggdrasil</h2>
    <p>Yggdrasil is a large genealogical project that my friend Atridad Lahiji
    and I recently started working on. The goal is to create a web application
    which the family historian can host for the rest of the family to view,
    allowing various visualizations, access to family memories (such as
    images, videos and stories) and fascilitating family members to suggest
    edits and corrections to the family tree.</p>

    <h2>Scripts</h2>
    
    <h3>lcc_mkdir</h3>
    <p>I enjoy collecting scans of old manuscripts, books and literary works.
    After some time I found that my collection was becoming increasingly
    unsorted. In order to combat this, I resolved myself to using the Library
    of Congress Classification system - a system similar to the Dewey Decimal
    System employed by the U.S. Library of Congress. This script pulls down
    the latest version of LCC categories/subcategories and creates a directory
    hierachy to aid in sorting. It is written in bash.</p>

    <h2>gogen</h2>
    <p>This simple command-line utility is meant to be used as a quick interface
    to the site <a href=http://gogen-allguide.com/>(put in the Kanji)</a>, a Japanese
    etymological dictionary. When learning a new language it is often
    useful to know the origin of words, as it can aid memorization. This project
    can be found on my GitHub <a href=github.com>here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Project Euler Framework</h2>
    <p>Project Euler is a programming challenge which helps developers become
    familiar with algorithm design and implementation. This project is a small
    framework to allow for the easy profiling and tracking of your various
    Project Euler solutions, in various languages.</p>

    <h2>Workstation Setup</h2>
    <p>In order to work efficiently, it's important that you have a setup that
    works for you. Below are some of the tools I use and how I have configured
    them to help me work.</p>

    <h3>Ranger</h3>

    <h3>vim</h3>

    <h3>i3-gaps</h3>

    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    
    <h2>Genealogy</h2>
    <p>I have always had a very strong interest in history, and over the past
    couple of years that has begun to manifest itself in an interest in
    family history and genealogy. I enjoy finding connections, documenting
    my family history, verifying information and compiling historical family
    stories.</p>
    
    <h2>Linguistics</h2>
    <p>I enjoy studying the linguistic aspects of various languages, most
    specifically Japanese, Russian, Czech, Polish and Norwegian.</p>
    
    <h2>Fountain Pens</h2>
    <p>Over the last few years I have amassed a sizeable colletion of fountain
    pens. I enjoy finding pens with odd nibs, weird filling systems and
    interesting histories. Below are some of such pens, including my most
    cherished pen which was previously owned by my grandfather.</p>
